# 🔧 Fix 403 Error - Branch Creation

## Problem
```
[CreateProject] Create branch response: 403
"message": "Resource not accessible by integration"
```

## Root Cause
Your current GitHub token doesn't have the required permissions. The OAuth scope was updated to include `workflow`, but your existing token still has the old scope.

## Solution

### Step 1: Logout
- Click logout in your app
- This clears the old token

### Step 2: Login Again
- Click "Login with GitHub"
- GitHub will ask for NEW permissions including:
  - ✅ repo (read/write)
  - ✅ user:email
  - ✅ workflow (NEW - required for branch creation)

### Step 3: Create Project
- After re-login, create a new project
- The branch will be created successfully

## Why This Happens
GitHub OAuth tokens are immutable. When we add new scopes, existing tokens don't automatically get the new permissions. Users must re-authenticate to get a new token with the expanded scope.

## Verify It's Fixed
After re-login, check the logs when creating a project:
```
[CreateProject] Creating branch JN_BHJHBK_AI_Fix for Ayush91225/vj
[CreateProject] ✅ Created branch JN_BHJHBK_AI_Fix
```

Instead of:
```
[CreateProject] ❌ Failed to create branch: 403
```
